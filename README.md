# Ethernaut-CTF
Blockchain CTF code created to exploit some levels of (very interesting) Ethernaut CTF (capture the flag) from Open Zeppelin that are still not documented as of today.

Files include in the top of the files the smartcontracts' code to be exploited and at the bottom, in the same files, the malicious smartcontracts that I created to exploit those. 
When deploying into the blockchain network (e.g. Ropsten Testnet) you should only deploy malicious smartcontract but before that, please update smartcontract instance addresses in the code that has to be exploited.

Enjoy and happy hacking! :)
